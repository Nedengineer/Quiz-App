# Quiz-App
This is my Quiz-App. It contains total 4 questions. The user starts the quiz by pressing the START Button, and then the Question is displayed on the screen. If the user guesses the correct option, then there is a NEXT Button which on clicking will proceed to the next question. At the end of the quiz, there is a RESTART Button to restart the quiz.
